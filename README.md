# RITracking-Android


A Tracking SDK for Android

The SDK can be integrated into Android application projects and provide convenient tracking via customizing convenience wrappers in subclasses (i.e. activities). The integrated trackers (Google Tag Manager, AD-X Tracking, AD4Push, etc.) are pervasively initialized using a central property list file bundled with the application to contain all required keys, token and further configuration. The tracking interface is initialized using a file path reference to the property list file.
